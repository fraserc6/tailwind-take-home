## What is it? 

My attempt at the take home project cloned from [Adam Wathan's](https://github.com/adamwathan/tailwind-take-home-project) Github. 
This was really fun to put together and a great way to apply Tailwind to a semi-real scenario. 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
